### Calculate the NEP and source coupling separately

- To comply with the DESHIMA 2.0 specs, the source coupling should be calculated for the power in the fitler bandwidth (that is between the crossover frequencies), and the NEP should be coupled with the total bandwidth (because the atmosphere is broadband)
